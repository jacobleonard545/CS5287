Let's begin the CA1 assignment which will be based on the CA0 assignment we just did. The instances are set up as conveyor-producer -> kafka-hub -> data-processor -> influx-db -> grafana-dash in terms of the data flow. Use terraform to create new instances in AWS that reproduces this exact process, verifying each instance data flow before moving onto the next instance. Do not move onto the next instance until confirmation has been given by me. The naming schemes should be CA-(name-of-instance) when creating new ones.
