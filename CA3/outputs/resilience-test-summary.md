## Test Execution Date
**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Status:** ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

---

## Test Objectives

Validate Kubernetes self-healing capabilities for the CA3 IoT data pipeline by performing controlled failure injection on critical components and observing automatic recovery.

---

## Test Scenarios & Results

### Test 1: Producer Pod Failure & Recovery

**Scenario:** Delete producer pod and observe Deployment-based recovery

**Steps:**
1. Identified running producer pod: `producer-58cdbb84df-h5n58`
2. Deleted pod: `kubectl delete pod producer-58cdbb84df-h5n58`
3. Observed automatic recreation by Deployment controller
4. Verified new pod: `producer-58cdbb84df-s77c9`

**Results:**
- ✅ New pod created automatically by Deployment controller
- ✅ Pod reached `Running` state in **33 seconds**
- ✅ Pod passed readiness probe
- ✅ Producer resumed sending messages to Kafka
- ✅ Logs show normal operation: `Speed: 0.214 m/s | State: running`

**Recovery Time:** 33 seconds

**Key Observations:**
- Kubernetes Deployment maintained desired replica count (1)
- New pod assigned different name (s77c9) but same ReplicaSet
- No manual intervention required
- Zero data loss (Kafka message delivery confirmed)

---

### Test 2: Processor Pod Failure & Recovery

**Scenario:** Delete processor pod and observe Deployment-based recovery

**Steps:**
1. Identified running processor pod: `processor-66cc659d46-n84q4`
2. Deleted pod: `kubectl delete pod processor-66cc659d46-n84q4`
3. Observed automatic recreation by Deployment controller
4. Verified new pod: `processor-66cc659d46-656t2`

**Results:**
- ✅ New pod created automatically by Deployment controller
- ✅ Pod reached `Running` state in **36 seconds**
- ✅ Pod passed readiness probe
- ✅ Processor reconnected to Kafka consumer group
- ✅ Logs show successful Kafka rebalancing: `Successfully joined group data-processor-group`

**Recovery Time:** 36 seconds

**Key Observations:**
- Kafka consumer group rebalanced automatically
- Consumer resumed from last committed offset (no message loss)
- Processor reconnected to InfluxDB over HTTPS
- Brief "Re-joining group" messages are normal Kafka behavior

---

### Test 3: Kafka StatefulSet Recovery

**Scenario:** Delete Kafka pod and observe StatefulSet-based recovery

**Steps:**
1. Identified running Kafka pod: `kafka-0`
2. Deleted pod: `kubectl delete pod kafka-0`
3. Observed StatefulSet recreation with same pod identity
4. Verified pod name preserved: `kafka-0`

**Results:**
- ✅ StatefulSet automatically recreated pod with same identity
- ✅ Pod reached `Running` state in **32 seconds**
- ✅ Pod passed readiness probe
- ✅ Kafka broker resumed with persistent data intact
- ✅ Logs show partition recovery: `Log loaded for partition`

**Recovery Time:** 32 seconds

**Key Observations:**
- StatefulSet preserved pod identity (kafka-0)
- Persistent volume claim remained bound throughout
- Kafka data persisted across pod restart
- Consumer offsets retained (no reprocessing of old messages)
- Producer and processor automatically reconnected

**Average Recovery Time:** 33.7 seconds

## Kubernetes Self-Healing Mechanisms Demonstrated

### 1. Deployment Controller
- Monitors desired vs actual replica count
- Automatically creates new pods when existing pods fail
- Ensures application availability
- Used by: Producer, Processor

### 2. StatefulSet Controller
- Maintains pod identity and ordering
- Recreates pods with same name and persistent storage
- Preserves stateful application data
- Used by: Kafka, InfluxDB

### 3. Readiness Probes
- Kubernetes only routes traffic to healthy pods
- Failed health checks trigger pod restart
- Prevents cascading failures

### 4. Resource Management
- Pod resource requests ensure schedulability
- Resource limits prevent runaway processes
- OOMKilled pods automatically restart

---

## Data Pipeline Integrity

### Message Flow Validation

**Before Failure:**
```
Producer → Kafka → Processor → InfluxDB
   ✓          ✓         ✓          ✓
```

**During Failure (Producer deleted):**
```
Producer → Kafka → Processor → InfluxDB
   ✗          ✓         ✓          ✓
```
- Kafka buffers messages in topic
- Processor continues consuming existing messages
- InfluxDB continues receiving writes

**After Recovery:**
```
Producer → Kafka → Processor → InfluxDB
   ✓          ✓         ✓          ✓
```
- New producer pod resumes message generation
- Pipeline fully operational
- No message loss

### Key Resiliency Features

1. **Kafka Message Buffering**
   - Messages stored in topic partitions
   - Consumer group tracks offsets
   - Messages never lost even if consumer fails

2. **InfluxDB Persistent Storage**
   - Data stored in PersistentVolumeClaim
   - Survives pod restarts
   - StatefulSet ensures volume reattachment

3. **Graceful Reconnection**
   - Applications use retry logic
   - Connection pools automatically reconnect
   - No operator intervention required

---

## Operator Response Procedures Validated

### Detection
- ✅ Pod failures visible in `kubectl get pods`
- ✅ Events logged in `kubectl describe pod`
- ✅ Logs show connection errors during outage

### Response
- ✅ Kubernetes automatically restarts failed pods
- ✅ No manual intervention required for transient failures
- ✅ Operator monitors recovery progress
- ✅ Escalate only if pod fails repeatedly (5+ restarts)

### Recovery Verification
- ✅ Check pod status: `kubectl get pods`
- ✅ Verify logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
- ✅ Confirm metrics in Grafana
- ✅ Test end-to-end data flow

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. Kubernetes self-healing is fast (30-40 seconds average)
2. StatefulSets preserve data across pod restarts
3. Kafka consumer groups handle rebalancing gracefully
4. No configuration changes needed for recovery
5. Monitoring tools (Grafana/Loki) continued functioning during failures

### Areas for Improvement
1. Could implement PodDisruptionBudgets for graceful maintenance
2. Could add liveness probes to detect hung processes
3. Could implement circuit breakers for cascading failure prevention
4. Could add alerting (Prometheus AlertManager) for proactive detection

### Production Recommendations
1. Run multiple replicas of all components (HA)
2. Implement multi-zone deployment for AZ failures
3. Use external monitoring (e.g., Datadog, New Relic)
4. Set up automated incident response (PagerDuty)
5. Regular disaster recovery drills

## Conclusion

The CA3 IoT data pipeline successfully demonstrated Kubernetes self-healing capabilities across all critical components. All three failure scenarios resolved automatically within 30-40 seconds without operator intervention or data loss.

**Key Takeaways:**
- ✅ Kubernetes provides robust self-healing for both stateless and stateful workloads
- ✅ Kafka's distributed architecture ensures message durability
- ✅ StatefulSets preserve data and identity across failures
- ✅ Proper configuration (probes, resource limits) enables reliable recovery
- ✅ Monitoring tools validate recovery and data integrity

**Milestone 9 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
